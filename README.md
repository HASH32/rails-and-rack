## Rails and Rack Apps

`Rails::Application` is a Rack application, which has a call method.

We can load only the required parts of Rails and serve it as a rack app. Read more about this at [Rails as Rack App Blog Post](https://blog.hash32.com/rails-as-rack-app/)


### Running this code ###

Ensure that you have installed rack before running the Rack apps.
```
gem install rack
```

Run `bundle install` in the rails_apps directories, to install dependent gems.
